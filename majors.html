      <p class="info">At The College of New Jersey (TCNJ), majors are designed to give students both a strong foundation in the liberal arts and in-depth knowledge of their chosen field. Students usually declare a major when applying, but many have the flexibility to explore courses during their first year before making a final decision. Each major combines core classes, specialized courses, and often hands-on experiences like research, internships, or fieldwork. Many programs also allow dual majors, minors, or interdisciplinary tracks, so students can tailor their education to fit their career goals.

In addition, TCNJ emphasizes close collaboration with faculty, giving undergraduates opportunities that are often reserved for graduate students at larger universities. Small class sizes mean students get personalized guidance and build strong academic relationships. Many majors include a capstone project or senior thesis, where students apply what they’ve learned to a real-world problem or research question. Graduates leave TCNJ well-prepared for careers, graduate school, or professional programs thanks to this well-rounded academic structure.</p>
